Minecraft Simple Automated Backup Script

This script was originally created by eNkrypt (Christopher S.) and was found at 
https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/simple-automated-backup-script-v0-5b-updated-3-20-14.5725/
As this script was very helpful to me I thought it would be useful to post so others
could use it too as the original link to the script has gone away. 

Be sure to read eNkrypt's original post at 
https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/simple-automated-backup-script-v0-5b-updated-3-20-14.5725/
for setup and configuration. 

I am not certain if the version I am posting here is the original version as I have edited it 
slightly to work with my configuration. If anyone has the original version let me know and 
I'll repost that version instead.
